# OutpostPlugin Beta
 
Unreal Engine 4.26 Plugin
v1.00

Attempted to recreate the outpost liberation mechanics from games like Farcy(s), Assassin's creed(s), Just cause(s), watchdogs(s) - basically what we see repeatedly in almost every title of Ubisoft :| 

This plugin provides only core code framework for : 
 - Outpost Actor
 - World map framework
 - Outpost Actor has unlock requirement arrays of type Enum::{switch/interact, kill, collect}
 - AI defenders
 - fast travel
However, it does not include any graphics assets(models/animation/soundfx) except placeholders with minimum memory-footprint.

*N.B: Currently in development. Not stable yet!*
